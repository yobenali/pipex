# Pipex
**Pipex** is a Unix-based project that explores the concept of inter-process communication by implementing a simplified version of the shell pipe operator ('|'). It is part of the curriculum at 1337 Coding School, a member of the prestigious 42 Network.


## Introduction
The **Pipex** project challenges students to deepen their understanding of Unix system calls, file descriptors, and process management. By creating a program that mimics the behavior of the shell pipe operator, students gain practical experience in manipulating data streams between processes.

## Project Overview
**Pipex** enables users to execute a series of commands consecutively, with the output of each command serving as the input for the next. This is achieved by redirecting standard input and output using file descriptors and creating a pipeline between the commands.

## Features
- **Command Execution**: Execute two external commands provided as arguments.
- **Input and Output Redirection**: Redirect input and output to and from files or standard input/output.
- **Error Handling**: Provide informative error messages in case of invalid input or execution failures.
- **Flexibility**: Support a wide range of command sequences and input/output combinations.
